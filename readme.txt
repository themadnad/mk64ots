About:
This is a project to assist with practicing Mario Kart 64  1-try matches. 
Feel free to use this source code and have fun practicing 1-tries.
I  will continue to update this code (It's fun to make things and  tinker with Python). 
If you have any suggestions or updates, please let me know. I hope together we can 
make this a useful tool for anyone who wants to practice MK64.

How to install:

Works on both Linux and Windows.

Make sure to have Python installed
https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once installed, open a command prompt (or terminal in Linux). 
Locate the directory of mk64ots.py. Run "python3 mk64ots.py" to start 
the script. Python can be a little weird to get working, so make sure to 
check Google first if it's giving you an error message.

I'll try to add some additional steps / instructions in the future.
